Hi 👋, I’m David Bozec aka. [@dbozec](https://github.com/dbozec/)

Electronics Engineer for [@OVHcloud](https://github.com/ovh), I mainly publish things electronics oriented. But as a FLOSS enthousiast I may also publish work concerning GNU/Linux or the FLOSS tools I use.

I can be found under the same pseudonym on few other plateforms like [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/dbozec.bsky.social), [mastodon](https://framapiaf.org/@dbozec), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/dbozec), ...
